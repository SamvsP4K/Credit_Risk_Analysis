# Credit Risk Analysis


## Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis was to use the sci-kit-learn and imbalanced-learn libraries to create multiple machine learning models to help predict credit risk.

## Data and Process

We were given a CSV file that can be found in the Data folder of this repository. The file contained multiple rows of data including loan amount, interest rates, payment installments, loan status etc. 

Loan Status was our target variable and the rest of the columns were used as features for each model. 

# Deliverables

For the first two deliverables, two oversampling algorithms were used Naive Randome oversampling and SMOTE. For both, the data was fit to the appropriate models created and an accuracy score and confusion matrix for precision and recall were printed. 
The last two deliverables used algorithms designed to reduce bias the Balanced Random Classifer and the Easy Ensemble Classifier. Similar steps were taken where the models were fit with the target and feature data and accuracy scores were printed for both.
